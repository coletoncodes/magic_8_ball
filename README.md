# What It Does

This application is a simple 8-ball application. You should ask your phone a question, and give it a tap! By doing so, it will give you the wisdom you seek.

**You can preview the app [here](https://coletoncodes-magic-8-ball.web.app/).**

 This will open up a browser version of the application.

# What I Learned

This project taught me the fundamentals of building stateful widgets with Flutter and solidified my knowledge in providing different asset images inside a single app.

**Some other skills I learned/used with this project:**
- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
- How to use Flutter stateful widgets to update the user interface.
- How to change the properties of various widgets.
- How to use onClick listeners to detect when buttons are pressed.
- How to use setState to mark the widget tree as dirty and requiring update on the next render.

- Understand and use string interpolation.
- Learn about basic dart programming concepts such as data types and functions.
- Code and use gesture controls.

### Features & Ideas For The Future

This is just a simple toy application, I don't have plans for the future. I suppose some more advanced animation would be nice.
